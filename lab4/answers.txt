# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

Our method for running peer downloads and uploads in parallel was to use fork()
to create new threads that would complete downloads and uploads for us.
Our version of osppeer has a single parent process create a new child process
for every download and upload instance. The child processes perform the download
or upload, and then exit, while the parent continues to spawn more download
and upload instances until the user interrupts it.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

Filename Buffer
Found a buffer overrun bug where if a filename longer than FILENAMESIZ-1 would
overflow the filename buffer. Bug was fixed by using a strncpy instead of a
strcpy, restricting the filename length to FILENAMESIZ, and always adding
the null terminator at the end of the string for when the buffer is later 
read or copied.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

1.  Block Peers from Downloading From Other Directories
When serving a peer, we first do a check on the filename the peer is requesting.
If the filename is too long (checked using strlen) or contains the '/' 
character (checked using a loop), we print a number of error statements, then
free that particular upload thread.

2.  Increase Robustness of the Task Buffer
The task buffer size TASKBUFSIZ is sometimes not large enough to accommodate
a large number of peers, causing us to prematurely disconnect from the tracker.
To fix this robustly, we would have to change how we read the buffer to only
read complete lines, not partial lines. We then have to rewrite the
read_tracker_response function to recognize near-full buffers, and inform
downloads to wait if the buffer is full.
This would require rewriting large sections of code. Instead we simply 
made the size of the task buffer 16 times larger, from 4096 to 65536.

2.  Prevent Peers from Sending Endless Data
